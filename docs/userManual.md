## Abstract
### Gamification

<p style="align-text: justify">&emsp;&emsp;Gamification is the incorporation of mechanics, style, mindset, and/or game design techniques to engage people in solving a problem and also efficiently promote behavior change. Gamification aims to improve user engagement, motivation, and performance when performing a specific task. Gamification has some similarities with games, but they are not the same. As the term implies, gamification is not about creating a game, but about transferring some positive characteristics of a game to a non-game context. These positive features of a game are often roughly described as "fun" and have the effect of engaging players in the activity.</p> 
<p style="align-text: justify">&emsp;&emsp;Some of the game elements found in gamification apps are points, badges, levels, leaderboards, challenges, rewards, etc. Other examples of game elements include avatars, teams, narratives, treasures, and ranks.</p>
<p style="align-text: justify">&emsp;&emsp;Game elements are relatively easy to recognize, probably because all of us have played games before. Points generally indicate how much time and effort a player has invested or the level of achievement reached. While points represent a player’s state since the beginning of a game, badges are used to signify the successful completion of a given task. Levels are a kind of stage in which a player develops skills and powers until he can unlock a new level to advance. Levels often serve as a reward system to encourage players to continue the game. Leaderboards list players by their score or achievements to create an environment for competition. According to Gamification Wiki, these game mechanisms can be divided into three types: Behavioral Mechanisms, Feedback Mechanisms, and Progress Mechanisms.</p>

## Users Type
<p style="align-text: justify">&emsp;Richard Bartle is a British writer, teacher and game researcher who defined in his research on virtual games that there are four types of player profiles. They are Achievers, Explorers, Killers, and Socializers. Achievers aim to stand out from other players by trying to earn points and level up. The Explorers are the most curious and try to enter and explore every part of the game. Killers are extremely competitive and want to win at any cost. In contrast to these types of players, there are the Socializers, who are interested in the game too but are more interested in enjoying the company of others.</p> 
<p style="align-text: justify">&emsp;If you are wondering which gamer type you are, do not worry, because all people have a percentage of all four gamer types.</p>
<p style="align-text: justify">&emsp;In this way, Spryte Labs has decided to divide its users according to The Bartle player type model and their activities within the platform.</p>
  
## Connections
<p style="align-text: justify">&emsp;Spryte Labs helps you not only develop these skills, but also connect with other users on the site, which Bartle Player Type says is an important measure for socializers. Here you have the opportunity to make connections with other users, companies and technologies in a variety of ways. By making connections, you have the chance to meet new people, build a network, and learn about new technologies in a new and innovative way. To facilitate access to these connections, the website provides you with a conversation widget that can be accessed from any page, allowing quick and direct access. </p>
<p style="align-text: justify">&emsp;To this end, users can deepen their personal relationships with other Spryte Labs users through social chats. But these are not ordinary chats. Conversational chats are group chats to which new members can be added at any time. This is a new way for sellers to connect with their customers and improve the connection with these potential buyers. Also, developers who are early in their careers have an easier time talking to more experienced people, which increases their chances of landing their first job through networking. In addition to these group conversations, you can talk directly to a company registered on the platform. </p>
<p style="align-text: justify">&emsp;Another feature in this section of Spryte Labs is technology tracking, where you receive personalized notifications about research, projects or companies using the technology. You can also select the industries sectors you are interested in and then receive the most relevant information on that topic. In addition, there is an option to track project types, so you can easily identify developers you want to buy from, or developers working on a project you also want to participate in. </p>

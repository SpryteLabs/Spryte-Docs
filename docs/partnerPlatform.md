# The Spryte Partner Platform

The Partner Platform is meant for Technology vendors and agencies. If you currently hire and manage developers to create custom technology for your clients,
you can become a Spryte Partner by registering on the platform.

## Benefits

There are many benefits to joining the Spryte platform as a development partner. Think of us as your window into a whole new world of clients and projects.
Partners are instantly accessible by all spryte clients, who can search for development teams in real time. Pricing is transparent to the user, but your information is never revealed.  

## Use cases

1. Get More projects
2. See how you fit within the competitor landscape, and fine tune your business
3. Improve margins and remove operational friction

## Registration

1. To register, log on to [The Spryte Partner Platform](https://spryte-partner.web.app/). We will ask you for basic information about your business. Make sure the person registering your account has an appropriate role within your organisation to handle rates & contract decisions.

2. You can enter your developer's information one by one from the **Resources** page in the **Developer Roster** grid. Make sure you hit ***UPDATE*** after adding new rows or before leaving the page. 

3. A unique ACCESS CODE is generated for each developer. Because adding in all the required information such as stack, domain and project experience can take long time, you can provide each developer in your company with their **access code** and **unique id**. Using the **Developer Login** screen, they can gain access to their own unique profile, and add the information which matches their resume (CV) at their leisure.

# The Spryte Partner Platform

The Partner Platform is meant for Technology vendors and Marketing Agencies. If you currently hire and manage developers to create custom technology for your clients,
you can become a Spryte Partner by registering on the platform. If you are a Marketing Agency and offer marketing services (which may or may not include development work), you ca also use the platform to market your services.

## Benefits

There are many benefits to joining the Spryte platform as a development partner. Think of us as your window into a whole new world of clients and projects.
Partners are instantly accessible by all spryte clients, who can search for development teams in real time. Pricing is transparent to the user, but your information is not revealed until after Clients have made a payment.  As a registered partner, you can also track your referral lead generation efforts and due commissions.

## Use cases

1. Get More projects
2. See how you fit within the competitor landscape, and fine tune your business
3. Improve margins and remove operational friction

## Registration

1. To register, turn to [The Home Page of the Spryte Website](https://www.sprytelabs.com), and fill in the "Technical Partner Registration" form.
We will review your information, and email you access credentials. Make sure the person registering your account has an appropriate role within your organisation to handle rates & contract decisions.

2. You can enter your developer's information one by one from the **Resources** page in the **Developer Roster** grid. Make sure you hit ***UPDATE*** after adding new rows or before leaving the page. 

3. A unique ACCESS CODE is generated for each developer. Because adding in all the required information such as stack, domain and project experience can take long time, you can provide each developer in your company with their **access code** and **unique id**. Using the **Developer Login** screen, they can gain access to their own unique profile, and add the information which matches their resume (CV) at their leisure. Individual developer pages have restricted access, they can add their own stacks, domains, project experience and personal information, but have no access to view or edit rates and any financial information.  

## Onboarding your Marketing Agency

The process for Marketing Agencies is slightly different than for Technical Partners. Of upmost importance are CASE STUDIES, which you can upload on the Documents Page. Depending on your billing situation, (billing by retainer) you may not need to add resources. If you wish to make onboarding swift, we recommend you add a single resource, and mark all your agency capabilities under the "Projects" section of that developer. 

## Adding a Case Study

It's easy to add a structured case study. By structured we mean that is conforms to a standard which can be used to display your case study to more clients, thereby leading more clients to you. Head over to the **BRANDING** screen, and click on the **ADD A CASE STUDY** button under the **Structured Case Study** section. 

![Structured Case Study](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Structured-Case-Study-001.jpeg)

Case studies have a default status of **DRAFT**. When you are happy with the information, images and structured tags (Stacks, Industry Domains, Project Types) of your case study, mark it as **READY-TO-SUBMIT** and a Spryte Account manager will review it for publication. Once they mark it as **FEATURED**, it will be displayed on your public company profile.

## Quick Onboarding for Staffing Firms -- Fulfilling your first requirement

Staffing firms can upload their first resource on the Spryte Platform and propose them for a client in under 5min. We highly recommend watching the full process via this video:

<div style="padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/771792320?h=fff8b46824&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Spryte-Partner-Quick-Onboarding-Staffing-v1-2022.mp4"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>



Fulfilling a requirement requires only a few steps:
  1. That you've read and signed the Spryte Terms & Conditions on the Open Requirements Page.
  2. That you've uploaded a Resource (manually, or via the resume uploader)
  3. That you've picked an Open Requirement with a position open to you

### Signing the Terms and Conditions

Before you can view requirement details or propose resources, you must review and accept the Spryte Terms & Conditions of sale. The signature is digitally signed and recorded. Click on the Terms link to view them, and click accept to sign.

![Unsigned Terms](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Unsigned-Terms.jpeg)

Once the terms have been accepted, the timestamp & user are recorded. When terms change, you will have to read and accept them again.

![Signed Terms](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Signed-Terms.jpeg)

Once Terms have been signed, you have access to view requirement details by pressing the blue magnifying glass icon on each requirement. Requirements which do not have this icon are not open to you, but if you feel you may be able to fulfill them, speak to your account manager. Requirements are Opened to you based on your past relationship with Spryte, as well as your markets and capabilities. If you want access to more requirements, take a look at adding your company details, case studies and Markets on the Branding & Market pages.

### Adding a Resource

See this section on [Adding Resources](#resume-upload)



## Onboarding your developer data as a Technical Partner

As an account manager, you have multiple options for adding information about your Developer Roster. You can enter all their information one-by-one, but to get started quickly we recommend using the **bulk-import** function. 

### Bulk Import

On the **RESOURCES** page of your admin account panel, you will find an empty grid, with a blue **BULK UPLOAD** button. 

![Resources Page](_media/partnerPlatform/Resources-All-v1.png)

You can use the [Excel Spreadsheet provided](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1su0ksN7-kTJTaq0U7-IXpNAhKgOESMxZYl_IsBpH7aM/edit?usp=sharing) to gather information from your team. Export it as a .csv, and copy the text into the bulk upload modal popup.

In case you have erroneous keys, the upload tool will inform you before saving. Ensure all rows are correct, and submit. Once you have successfully imported your developer roster, they will be displayed in the Resources Grid. 

We recommend you bulk-upload a roster of 50-100 developers to start with, in groups of 20-30.     

### Resume Upload

On the **RESOURCES** page of your admin account panel, you will find an empty grid, and to the top right of the grid a a blue **RESUME UPLOAD** button.
You can select up to 20 CVs in PDF format and they will be scraped for relevant information. **Be aware that it takes approximatly 20s per resume. If any errors occur you will be notified.**  The AI is still learning, so you can review the information for each scraped resume and choose "**IMPORT**" to keep what has been tagged, or "**EXCLUDE**" if the information is incorrect. (For example, random Stack names like *Section* or *Lateral* may be found in the body text of the CV which don't actually apply to this developer.) Fill out all the required info for each dev and click submit when you are done with ALL the CVs.

If you wish to distribute this work to individual developers on your staff, they also have the ability to upload their resume on their unique developer page. (see Registration / Point #3)


### Using the Resources Grid

You can select a developer from the grid, and their information will be displayed below. You can also double-click the developer to edit their information. You can also add individual developers, or remove them. 

> **Developers you enter into the Spryte Platform are automatically covered by our non-compete agreement, which means they cannot be hired/contracted without your approval by either Spryte or our Clients.**

#### Fields in the Resource grid: 
1. **Internal Id**: An internal code (your internal system code) you can use to track resources across Spryte and your own system.   
2. **First Name** : Developers you identify with full names are covered by the Non-Solicitation clause of our terms and conditions. Neither Spryte nor our clients can solicit employment from your resources without your express permission.
3. **Last Name**: If you do not wish to share developer full names, you may use a pseudonym or a single letter for their last name. We will need their full names before they can be contracted.
4. **Position**: Currently Spryte positions can be one of 
    - Architect
    - Jr. Developer
    - Mid. Developer
    - Sr. Developer
    - Designer
    - UI/UX
5. **Status**: An **Active** developer can be booked, an **Inactive** developer cannot be booked. We recommend you add your entire developer roster, and use the status toggle for developers you would like to book in the next few months.
6. **Rating**: A float rating (0.00 0 4.00) you can use to indicate your developer's standing within your team. This is YOUR evaluation of your developer's skill. Spryte rates your developers taking into consideration many inputs. Setting all your developers to the maximum has a negative influence on how we use it towards the overall rating. 
7. **Hourly Rate**: Your resource's hourly rate in USD. This is the amount you expect to receive from Spryte for your resource. All Spryte Contracts are paid per 80h Sprint.   
8. **Location**: The full text name of your developer's location. We recommend you use the city name. (i.e. New York, Bangalore, Kiev...)
11. **Access Code**: This random auto-generated code can be changed for security. It allows your developers access to their own profile page. Use it to speed up onboarding and improve accuracy by making your developers add their own stack, domain & project experience. It should take them no more than 20 minutes for a very detailed profile.
12. **Developer ID**: This is your developer's unique ID within the Spryte platform. It is permanent. 

![Editing a developer's information](_media/partnerPlatform/Editing-Developer.png)

### Exporting your resources grid and Dev Sign-In

Instead of adding information for all your developers, you can send them their ID and Access Code. They can use the **Developer Sign-In** to edit their own profile. While the **Developer ID** is unique and persistent, you can change their access code at any time. Change their access code if you wish to prevent unauthorized editing. 

![Dev ID & Access Code](_media/partnerPlatform/DeveloperID-blurred.png)

----------------------------

## Editing your Developer Profile

### Access
Each developer on a SPRYTE PARTNER roster can add/modify information on their profile at will. Your employer must provide you with your **Developer ID** as well as your **Access Code**. While your Developer ID is unique and persistent, your access code may be changed at will by your account manager. If you have difficulties logging-in, ask your account manager for the latest Access Code.

![Developer Login](_media/partnerPlatform/Developer-Login-v2.png)

###  Editing your personal profile details

Each developer can edit their own information. The details are personal and change frequently as developers learn new technologies, improve their skills and accrue experience. The SPRYTE algorithm looks at all this information when picking teams.

![Developer Profile Page](_media/partnerPlatform/Developer-Login-details.png)

The SPRYTE Matching algorithm currently takes into account:

#### Stacks

Your tech stacks are specific languages, libraries, tools, and systems. The list is curated by Spryte staff based on multiple criteria. There are thousands of referenced libraries, therefore is it important that you add as much detail as possible. This will make it easier for you to be booked.

NOTE: Spryte takes this information very seriously. We expect you to be truthful. If our audits determine the information you provided is innacurate and you have significantly overestimated your capabilities, you may lose the ability to be booked on the platform until the problem is rectified. 

![Stacks Page](_media/partnerPlatform/Developer-Stacks.png)

#### Domain Knowledge

Clients are interested in your technical abilities, but your ability to speak their language, and understand their problems is key to project success. As such domain knowledge, which is prior experience working in a specific market, is extremely useful for our clients. For example, if you have previously worked on a payment integration project which lasted 6 months for a finance firm, mark your domain knowledge as Finance, 6 months, 1 project, Skill 1-4. 

![Domains Page](_media/partnerPlatform/Developer-Domain.png)

#### Project Types

Clients often look for developers who have already proven themselves on a particular project type. Perhaps you have substantial experience using APIs (Google, Facebook, Stripe, Twitter...), and as such you will be faster in implementing this again for a new client. Mark down any experience you have for any of the project categories we are currently tracking.

![Projects Page](_media/partnerPlatform/Developer-ProjectExperience.png)

#### Vacations

Please add your planned vacations for the next year. You can modify this at any time. Your account manager can see all your vacation information, while the clients you work for can see vacations you plan to take which affect their timeline.

#### Availability

Any projects booked through SPRYTE will be automatically displayed here. You may also add any other projects you are working on which may impact your availability towards bookings on the Spryte platform. For example, if you have an ongoing project and do not wish to be booked until it finishes, add a row describing your current project, and specifying the end date. The spryte platform will automatically try to book projects to keep you active.

### Profile Completion Score

In order for your developers to be considered on the platform, they must have a 100% Profile Completion Score. Each developer must have:
   1. 8 Stacks Minimum
   2. 4 Project Types
   3. 1 Domain 

   Developers who do not meet this criteria are probably too junior to be included. If your developers meet criteria we don't have on the platform currently, (stacks, domains or project types) please submit new types for review by using the "Request new Type" button. 


----------------------------

# Markets

Markets allow clients to find your pricing and teams, without having to specify each individual resource and their availability on the resources panel. You should be able to define a dozen markets your company is great at.

When you initially load the markets page, you'll we first ask you to define your applicable positions & experience.

![Initial Screen](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-002.jpeg)

#### Step 1: Define your Applicable Positions & Experience

Head over to the **Accounts** screen, where you'll find the **Generic Service Settings**. 

![Generic Service Settings](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-003.jpeg)

Click on the **Edit** button for each position you would like to enable and add pricing for. This is dependent on how you setup your rate cards. Click the CheckBox to enable the position, then set the correct amount of **Experience** and **Projects** for each. Finally, click Save. 

The Skill Trust Score is set by Spryte, depending on our experience working with you.

![Generic Service Settings](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-004.jpeg)

#### Step 2: Define a Rate Card

Rate cards are prices, defined for each type of developer you have. There are a few ways to setup rate cards depending on how your company operates. Back on the **Markets** screen, now that you've added your generic service settings, you'll see you now have 3 sections: Rate Cards, Your Markets, and Popular Markets.

![Rate Cards](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-005.jpeg)

Click on the **ADD A RATE CARD** button, and you'll be able to define a new rate card.

![Rate Cards](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-006-b.jpeg)

Add a team location, and click on the **MAP** button. Spryte uses the google map api to find the unique geolocation of that address. If your team is in Bangalore, type the city name, and it will be mapped. You may add multiple locations, but we recommend keeping it down to 5 locations maximum per rate card.

You must agree to the terms in order to activate the rate card, which you must do by changing the **STATUS** to **ACTIVE**, before saving. You may save an inactive rate card for later use, but it will not be selectable in the Markets tab.

Congratulations! You've just added your first Rate Card.

![Rate Cards](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-007.jpeg)

#### Step 3: Add a Market

Markets are combinations of Stacks, Industry Domains and Project Types. If your company is good at creating Custom Websites for the Marketing Industry, using Wordpress, then type in and select each one in turn ("Custom Website", "Marketing" & "Wordpress").

![Rate Cards](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-008.jpeg)  

![Rate Cards](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-009.jpeg)

Then click on **ADD CUSTOM PRICING**. You'll be taken to that market screen, where you can apply rate cards.

![Rate Cards](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-010.jpeg)

Click on the blue **APPLY PRICING CARD** button, and select a rate card. Only Active Rate Cards are shown on this screen.

![Rate Cards](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-011.jpeg)

Once you apply a rate card, Spryte computes pricing and teams for all possible combinations of:
  1. Teamsizes 1-8
  2. Locations
  3. Positions
  4. Combinations of all the search criteria (stacks, industry domains & project types)

The Variants number shown is the number of possible team combinations for which we can show our clients your pricing. It takes a few seconds to compute.

![Rate Cards](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-012.jpeg)

Click the **GO BACK** button on the top left of the screen to head back to the **Markets** screen. Congratulations, you've added your first market, and clients can now find your pricing on Sprytelabs.com!

![Rate Cards](_media/partnerPlatform/Spryte-Partner-Markets-013.jpeg)

The **Combinations** number is the number of pricing pages clients can find your pricing on.

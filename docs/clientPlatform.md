# The Spryte Client Platform

Spryte's tech marketplace allows anyone looking for technology development for find the right team in 3-clicks. We believe that

> "Finding and managing a tech team should be easy, fast, and transparent"

Under the hood, and in order to make this happen, we compute trillions of combinations of developers for each client request. To find the perfect team, we currently combine developers based on the following parameters: 
- Availability
- Pricing
- Tech Stack
- Domain Knowledge
- Project Experience
- Team Size
- Geolocation

We provide real-time data based confirmed availability, much like modern hotel/airline GDS's.

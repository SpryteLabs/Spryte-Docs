# Admins

In this article, features available exclusively to admins across all Spryte platforms are described. Anything which doesn't fit neatly into one of the other articles is explained here.

## Requirement Statuses

Requirements may be set to have different statuses. Among them are "paused", "cancel", and "delete".
"cancel" and "delete" are irreversible. Once a requirement is cancelled or deleted, it cannot be modified.
Similarly a "paused" requirement may not be modified, but it may be resumed, after which it may be modified again.

To modify the status of a requirement, click the kebab menu (three vertical dots) in the top right corner of the requirement card, and select the desired status from the dropdown menu.

## Transfer Requirment

To transfer a requirement to another Spryte client, the page must be in admin mode. To turn admin mode on, select "View as Admin" from the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the page. Once admin mode is on, click the kebab menu (three vertical dots) in the top right corner of the requirement card, and select "Transfer Requirement" from the dropdown menu. Search for, and select, a client to transfer the requirement to.
